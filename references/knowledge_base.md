# TreeCL Knowledge Base (from references PDFs)

This file captures facts and implementation-relevant notes extracted from the PDFs in
`references/`. It is meant to be a stable, local summary for TreeCL development.

- Syntax (BNF): M, N ::= 4 | M N. Application is left-associative; each "4" is a node,
  and each application M N adds an edge from the root of M to the root of N.
- Natural tree classes:
  - Leaf: a node with no branches (4).
  - Stem: a node with one branch (4 x).
  - Fork: a node with two branches (4 x y), with ordered left/right branches.
- Programs/values are binary trees: leaves, stems, and forks whose branches are also
  binary trees. Any tree containing a node with three or more branches is a
  computation that must be evaluated. A term 4 M N P triggers evaluation, so 4 is a
  ternary operator that fires when it has three arguments.
- Core evaluation rules (K, S, F), driven by the structure of the first argument:
  - 4 4 y z = y
  - 4 (4 x) y z = y z (x z)
  - 4 (4 w x) y z = z w x
  Notes: K deletes the third argument, S duplicates the third argument, and F
  decomposes the first argument to expose its branches.
- Basic combinators in tree calculus:
  - K = 4 4
  - I = 4 (4 4) (4 4)
  - D = 4 (4 4) (4 4 4)
  - d{x} is shorthand for 4 (4 x) in derivations.
- Fundamental queries exist for structural inspection:
  - isLeaf, isStem, isFork can be defined using a generalized "query" that
    distinguishes leaf/stem/fork.
  - A "triage" combinator packages these tests to select among three functions
    based on whether its argument is a leaf, stem, or fork. This is used by
    programs like size and equality.
- Evaluation strategies are defined within tree calculus:
  - Branch-first: evaluate branches before evaluating the root.
  - Root evaluation: evaluate only enough to determine leaf/stem/fork (factorable
    forms), potentially leaving branches unevaluated (quoted).
  - Root-and-branch: perform root evaluation, then recursively evaluate branches.
  These strategies are used to build self-evaluators.

- Evaluation rule for function calls:
  - Evaluate arguments left-to-right.
  - Apply the operator (function) to the evaluated arguments.
- quote is a special operator: it returns its argument verbatim (no evaluation).
  The reader abbreviation ' is equivalent to quote.
- if is a special operator: evaluates the test, then evaluates only one branch.
  The else branch is optional and defaults to nil.
- and/or are macros: they short-circuit, evaluating only as many arguments as needed.
- nil is both the empty list and false. t is the default truth value; anything other
  than nil is treated as true. The functions null and not both test for nil.
- Closures:
  - A closure is a function plus an environment.
  - Closures are created when a function refers to free lexical variables; the
    variables persist as long as the closure does.
